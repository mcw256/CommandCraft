Minecraft doesn't detect .mcfunction, even though it's in the right location.**This is very common. It probably means, that mcfunction contains a block that isn't in your minecraft version, or it was badly translated by CommandCraft. To fix this error, go to ```C:\Users\_thatsyou_\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\logs```, then open latest log file, and look for block that caused error.After that, you can add your custom translation for this block to the ```programdata\user_block_dictionary.json``` file, which is loaded at the start by CommandCraft.- - -
